/*
This code is written in JavaScript, specifically using Redux, which is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. 
Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), 
and are easy to test. 
It is commonly used with libraries like React or Angular for building user interfaces.

The commented line of code is:  `// import all reducers and combine them into one`.

This suggests that multiple reducers are being combined into one single root reducer.
This is a common practice in Redux applications when you have different parts of state that are managed by different reducers.

The next few lines of code are imports:
```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import posts from './posts.js'
import auth from './auth.js'
```
Here, `{ combineReducers }` is imported from 'redux'.
This function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function. 
The reducers `posts` and `auth` are imported from their respective files('./posts.js' and './auth.js').

In Redux, 'reducers' specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. 
For instance, a post reducer may update the number of likes on a post while the auth reducer may update the user's login status.

The last few lines:
```javascript
export default combineReducers ({
    posts,
    auth
})
```
combineReducers is called with an object that contains the `posts` and `auth` reducers.
This will create a single root reducer out of them.
Consequently, when an action is dispatched, `combineReducers` ensures that each reducer
gets called and gets a chance to update its part of the state.
Finally, it's exported as a default, meaning that other modules can import this combined reducer without knowing its name. 
This is usually imported in the store setup where it is used to create a new Redux store.
